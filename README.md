📦 Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on retail demand forecasting and inventory optimization to identify stockout risks, optimize reorder points, and support data-driven inventory decisions.

Using historical sales data, the project:

Forecasts future demand

Compares inventory levels vs expected demand

Identifies inventory gaps leading to potential stockouts

Provides actionable insights through an interactive dashboard

This simulates a real-world retail analytics use case faced by supply chain and operations teams.

🎯 Objectives

Forecast future sales using historical transaction data

Identify inventory shortages and stockout risks

Optimize reorder points

Visualize demand vs inventory mismatches

Support proactive inventory planning

🗂️ Dataset Description

The analysis uses cleaned and transformed retail data derived from online transaction records.

📈 Key Insights

Persistent negative inventory gaps indicate high stockout risk

Demand shows a clear upward trend, requiring inventory scaling

Current reorder points are insufficient for forecasted demand

Proactive inventory planning can significantly reduce lost sales

🚀 Business Impact (Simulated)

📉 Reduced stockout risk

📦 Optimized reorder timing

💰 Improved demand fulfillment

📊 Better supply chain decision-making
